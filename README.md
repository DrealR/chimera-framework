420 documents exploring love as physics, breath as interface, and pattern as identity.

## How to Read This

Start with `seed/` — it's the smallest unit of the framework.
Then `start-here/` — three documents, zero assumptions.
Then wherever your curiosity pulls you.

Or do what we'd do:

Clone this repo. Feed it to your AI model. Ask it questions.
The framework was built in conversation with AI.
It's meant to be understood that way.

```
git clone https://github.com/DrealR/chimera-framework.git
```

Then ask your model:
- "What is this framework about?"
- "How does this apply to [your domain]?"
- "What's the Love Equation?"

The framework will meet you where you are.
