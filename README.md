# CHIMERA

Everything is one thing appearing as many things.

## The Idea in 30 Seconds

There's a pattern that shows up everywhere — in how you breathe, how games are played, how economies work, how relationships last, how systems stay alive. Two poles and a space between them. Give more than you take. Pause before you act. Don't force what isn't there.

That's it. This repo is 420+ documents exploring that idea across physics, consciousness, economics, AI, fiction, and lived experience.

## Start Here (pick one)

**If you think in systems:**
Read [seed/the-seed.md](seed/the-seed.md) — one page, the whole idea.

**If you like stories:**
Read [start-here/the-breath.md](start-here/the-breath.md) — love explained through Interstellar, The Matrix, and One Piece.

**If you want the core idea and nothing else:**
Give more than you take. Pause before you act. Don't force what isn't there. That's the whole framework. Everything else is that idea applied to different domains.

## The AI Way

This was built in conversation with AI. It's meant to be understood that way.

```
git clone https://github.com/DrealR/chimera-framework.git
```

Feed it to your AI model. Then ask:
- "What is this about?"
- "How does this connect to [something I care about]?"
- "Show me the simplest version of this."

## Structure

```
seed/        one idea, one page
start-here/  three documents, zero assumptions
core/        the philosophy
deep/        the connections
library/     everything else
```

Go as deep as you want. Or stay at the seed. Both are complete.
