# CHIMERA

Everything is one thing appearing as many things.

This is 420+ documents exploring that idea — through physics, basketball, chess, consciousness, AI, economics, and whatever else it touches.

## How to Read This

Start with `seed/` — one document, one idea.
Then `start-here/` — three documents, zero assumptions.
Then wherever your curiosity pulls you.

Or do what we'd do:

Clone this repo. Feed it to your AI model. Ask it questions.
The framework was built in conversation with AI.
It's meant to be understood that way.

```
git clone https://github.com/DrealR/chimera-framework.git
```

Then ask your model:
- "What is this about?"
- "How does this connect to [something I care about]?"
- "Show me the simplest version of this."
