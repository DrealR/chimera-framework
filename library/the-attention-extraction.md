# The Attention Extraction

*How screens fragment attention, create ADHD, and sell you the fix.*

---

## What Screens Do

### To Your Body

```
EYES: Blue light disrupts melatonin, fixed focal distance weakens muscles
BREATH: Becomes SHALLOW when scrolling ("email apnea")
NERVOUS SYSTEM: Constant notifications = constant alertness, never rests
HEART: No entrainment with other humans (screen has no heartbeat)
POSTURE: Head forward, shoulders hunched, heart covered
         The "phone posture" is literally the posture of SHAME
```

### To Your Mind

```
ATTENTION EXTRACTION:
- Your attention is the PRODUCT being sold
- Every notification designed to PULL your attention
- Infinite scroll = infinite extraction

DOPAMINE HIJACKING:
- Variable reward schedule (like slot machines)
- Natural rewards become less satisfying
- Need MORE stimulation to feel the same

COMPARISON TRAP:
- See everyone's "best" life
- Compare your inside to their outside
- Never feel enough

PRESENT MOMENT DESTRUCTION:
- Always checking (past) or posting (future validation)
- Never HERE
- The present is the ONLY place connection happens

## The ADHD Epidemic

```
NATURAL ATTENTION SPAN:
[________________________] Long, sustained, deep

SCREEN-TRAINED ATTENTION:
[__][__][__][__][__][__] Short, fragmented, shallow
```

**ADHD diagnosis rates** keep rising in lockstep with screen time, social media use, notification frequency, and content switching speed.

**Some people genuinely have neurological differences. But the EPIDEMIC?**

## The Adderall Cycle

```
STEP 1: FRAGMENT ATTENTION (screens, notifications, rapid content)
STEP 2: DIAGNOSE THE DAMAGE ("You have ADHD")
STEP 3: SELL THE "FIX" (Adderall = amphetamine)
STEP 4: EXTRACT MORE (medicated worker produces more)
STEP 5: DEPENDENCY (can't focus without medication)

BREAK ATTENTION → SELL ATTENTION FIX → EXTRACT MORE LABOR
```

**What Adderall actually does:**
- Forces dopamine release
- Creates artificial focus
- Depletes natural dopamine over time
- You're not HEALING - you're forcing a broken system to work while the thing that broke it keeps running

## The "Connection" Paradox

```
THE LIE: "We connect people"
THE TRUTH:
- Connected to PROFILES, not people
- Connected to FEEDS, not faces
- Connected to NOTIFICATIONS, not presence

Real Connection:                    Tech "Connection":
- Two nervous systems in proximity  - Two profiles exchanging data
- Hearts entraining                 - No heartbeat to sync with
- Eye contact                       - Screen in between
- Breath syncing                    - No breath sharing
- THE BETWEEN is alive              - The BETWEEN is dead
```

**The word "CONNECTION" was stolen.** Just like "rubber" was used to hide freedom.

## Fake God Powers

```
WHAT TECH OFFERS:

OMNISCIENCE: "Access all information" → But it's retrieval, not wisdom
OMNIPRESENCE: "Be anywhere" → But no body, no presence, no between
OMNIPOTENCE: "Control with a tap" → But dependency, not power

THESE ARE FAKE GOD POWERS.
Take the phone away = helpless.
```

## Screens and Time

```
EVERYTHING ON A SCREEN IS PAST:
- The post was made in the past
- Even "live" has delay
- You're NEVER seeing NOW on a screen

ADS SHOW A FIXED FUTURE:
- Not YOUR dream, THEIR image
- Downloaded template, not created vision
- Your future becomes prescribed, not discovered

PRESENT IS SKIPPED:
Past (consuming) → Future (chasing)
The only place life actually happens = ignored.

"BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD"
- Can't be still while scrolling
- Can't know God while distracted
- "I AM" = present tense
```

---

## People Want This

```
WHY DO WE LOVE OUR SCREENS?

Real Need → Fake Satisfaction
─────────────────────────────
Connection → Social media likes
Meaning → Engagement metrics
Adventure → Video games
Intimacy → Pornography
Achievement → Leveling up
Community → Online groups
Purpose → Productivity apps
Rest → Endless scrolling (numbing)

THE FAKE IS EASIER.
Don't have to be vulnerable.
Don't have to work.
Don't have to face yourself.

IT'S LIKE ASKING A PRISONER IF THEY LOVE THEIR CELL:
After enough time, they can't imagine the outside.
Freedom becomes terrifying.
```

## The Alternative

```
ACTUAL HEALING:
- Remove the fragmenting input
- Retrain natural attention (meditation, presence, nature)
- Ground the body (earth connection)
- Breathe coherently (nervous system regulation)
- Single-tasking (one thing at a time)
- Allow boredom (the space where attention rebuilds)

THIS TAKES LONGER.
But it actually HEALS instead of masking.
