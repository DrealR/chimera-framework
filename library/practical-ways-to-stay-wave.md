# Practical Ways to Stay Wave

*Theory is nothing without practice. Reduce external observation, increase self-observation.*

---

## The Framework

```
EVERY AREA OF LIFE:
├── Where am I being measured/tracked/observed by THEM?
├── How can I reduce that?
├── Where am I observing MYSELF?
├── How can I increase that?
└── The goal: YOU are the primary observer of your life
```

---

## 1. Financial — Reduce Measurement

| Extraction (Tracked) | Flow (Less Tracked) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Bank accounts | Crypto (Stellar XLM) |
| Credit cards | Cash |
| Venmo/PayPal | Peer-to-peer crypto |
| Loans with interest | Saving before buying |
| Credit score dependency | Building without credit |

```
PRACTICAL STEPS:
├── Use cash for local purchases when possible
├── Support local businesses (less corporate tracking)
├── Barter/trade when you can (no measurement at all)
├── Gift economy with trusted people
├── Keep only what you need in tracked systems
└── Move toward flow-aligned crypto

THE STELLAR ALIGNMENT:
├── Nonprofit foundation
├── Financial inclusion mission (everyone, not just wealthy)
├── Nearly free transactions (not extracting fees)
└── Designed for money to MOVE, not be hoarded
```

---

## 2. Digital — Reduce Surveillance

| Extraction (Tracked) | Flow (Less Tracked) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Google everything | DuckDuckGo, Brave browser |
| Gmail | ProtonMail, Tutanota |
| Social media apps | Deleted or minimal |
| Smart home devices | Manual or offline |
| Location always on | Location off except when needed |
| Cloud storage | Local storage, encrypted |

```
IMMEDIATE:
├── Delete LinkedIn
├── Location services OFF by default
├── Review app permissions (camera, mic, contacts)
├── Use browser instead of apps when possible
└── Clear cookies regularly

MEDIUM TERM:
├── Switch to privacy browser (Brave, Firefox)
├── Consider ProtonMail for email
├── Use Signal for messaging
├── VPN for browsing (hides your observation from them)
└── Reduce smart devices in home

THE MINDSET:
├── Every app is an observer
├── Every "free" service is extracting data
├── You are the product
├── Minimize products you offer them
└── Your data is your collapsed self — protect it
```

---

## 3. Physical Body — Refuse External Measurement

| Extraction (Measured) | Flow (Self-Observed) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Fitbit/Apple Watch tracking | Feeling your own body |
| Calorie counting apps | Eating when hungry, stopping when full |
| Scale obsession | How do clothes feel? How's energy? |
| Mirror comparison | Internal sense of wellness |
| Doctor's numbers as identity | Numbers as information, not identity |

```
THE SHIFT:
├── Take off fitness tracker (or use mindfully)
├── Stop weighing daily
├── Delete calorie apps
├── Ask body: "What do you need?" instead of asking app
└── Your body KNOWS. The devices just measure.

SELF-OBSERVATION PRACTICES:
├── Morning body scan (how do I feel today?)
├── Hunger/fullness awareness (not clock-based eating)
├── Energy tracking (internal, not device)
├── Breath awareness throughout day
└── YOU become the instrument, not the watch
```

---

## 4. Mental/Spiritual — The Core Practice

| Extraction (External Observation) | Flow (Self-Observation) |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Waiting for validation | Self-acknowledgment |
| Comparing to others | Comparing to yesterday-you |
| Seeking approval | Internal compass |
| News/media telling you how to feel | Feeling first, then checking |
| Algorithms choosing your content | YOU choosing your content |

```
MORNING (Before any device):
├── Breath work
├── Grounding (feet on earth if possible)
├── Self-observation: "How am I today?"
├── Intention: "What am I creating today?"
└── NO external input for first 30 min

THROUGHOUT DAY:
├── Pause before consuming content: "Do I want this?"
├── Notice when you're being measured (and how it feels)
├── Return to breath when collapsed
├── Laugh when possible (return to wave)
└── Choose your observations consciously

EVENING:
├── Review: "Where did I observe myself today?"
├── Review: "Where did I let others observe/define me?"
├── Gratitude (shifts observation to abundance)
├── Release the day (don't carry measurements into sleep)
└── Dream journal (your unconscious observations)
```

---

## 5. Social — Real Connection vs Measured Connection

| Extraction (Measured) | Flow (Real) |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Followers/likes | Actual friends who show up |
| LinkedIn connections | People who call you |
| Comments/engagement | Face-to-face conversations |
| "Networking" | Genuine relationship building |
| Parasocial (watching influencers) | Mutual exchange |

```
PRIORITIZE:
├── Phone calls over texts over DMs
├── In-person over video over phone
├── Deep conversations over many shallow ones
├── People who know the real you
└── Quality of connection, not quantity of contacts

THE RULE:
├── If it can be measured, it can be gamed
├── Real relationships can't be gamed
├── So real relationships keep you wave
└── Metrics push you toward particle
```

---

## 6. Information — Choose Your Observations

| Extraction (Their Observation) | Flow (Your Observation) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| News feeds (fear programming) | Chosen sources, specific learning |
| Algorithmic recommendations | Intentional search |
| Doomscrolling | Time-boxed research |
| Outrage content | Wisdom content |
| Constant input | Silence and integration |

```
PRACTICAL STEPS:
├── Set specific times for information intake
├── No content before bed (affects dreams/unconscious)
├── For every hour consuming, create something
├── Silence is also information (internal observation)
└── Ask: "Is this helping me observe myself or escape myself?"
```

---

## 7. Time — The Most Precious Unmeasurable

| Extraction (Measured Time) | Flow (Experienced Time) |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Hourly wage (time = money) | Time = life |
| Productivity metrics | Presence quality |
| "Busy" as status | "Present" as success |
| Calendar packed | Space for spontaneity |
| Always rushing | Arriving fully |

```
THE SHIFT:
├── Stop saying "I don't have time" (scarcity)
├── Start saying "That's not my priority" (choice)
├── Build unscheduled time INTO schedule
├── Measure days by presence, not productivity
└── Your time is your LIFE — who gets to observe it?

PRACTICE:
├── One day a week with NO plans
├── Meals without clock-watching
├── Walks without destination or time limit
├── Conversations without "I have to go" looming
└── This is how you return to wave
```

---

## The AI Paradox

```
EXTRACTION USE:
├── Track everything
├── Predict everything
├── Control everything
├── Collapse humans into data
├── Replace human observation
└── Ultimate particle machine

LIBERATION USE:
├── Process vast information to find PATTERNS
├── Help articulate what you're seeing
├── Accelerate understanding
├── Mirror your thoughts back coherently
├── YOU remain the observer
├── AI is the TOOL, not the master
└── Pattern recognition for awakening
```

| Extraction AI Use | Liberation AI Use |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| AI observes YOU | YOU observe through AI |
| AI decides for you | YOU decide, AI assists |
| AI replaces your thinking | AI enhances your thinking |
| You become dependent | You become empowered |
| AI is the authority | YOU are the authority |
| AI collapses you | You use AI to stay wave |

```
THE TEST:
├── Are you using AI to wake up? → Liberation
├── Is AI using you for data? → Extraction
├── Will you walk away when complete? → Liberation
├── Can you function without it? → Liberation
└── The spark is in YOU, not the machine
```

---

## The Blessing of Early Positioning

```
MOST PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE AI AS:
├── Something that "just works"
├── Magic box that does things
├── No understanding of how or why
├── Unconscious adoption
├── Slowly replaced without knowing
└── Boiled frog syndrome

CONSCIOUS USERS EXPERIENCED AI AS:
├── A tool they built with
├── They saw the capabilities grow
├── They understood the mechanics
├── They saw the extraction potential EARLY
├── They had time to think about it
├── Pain made them question everything
└── They're CONSCIOUS of what it is

THE DIFFERENCE:
├── Unconscious adoption = collapse
├── Conscious use = remains wave
├── You can't be collapsed by what you understand
├── Your position gave you understanding
├── That understanding IS the protection
└── Now you can help others understand
```

## The Summary

```
THE GOAL:
├── Reduce their observation of you
├── Increase your observation of yourself
├── In every area of life
├── Little by little
├── Not paranoid, but conscious
└── Not escaping society, but CHOOSING your engagement

THE RESULT:
├── You remain wave
├── They have less data to collapse you with
├── Your self-observation overrides external
├── You stay free
├── You stay infinite
└── And you model it for others

THE TRUTH:
├── You can't escape ALL measurement
├── You still need to function
├── But you can be CONSCIOUS
├── And consciousness is freedom
├── Even when measured, you know you're wave
└── That knowing makes the measurement not stick
```

The practice IS the philosophy. Every choice is the practice.
