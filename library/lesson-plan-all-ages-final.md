# 🏀 UPDATED 10-MINUTE LESSON — ALL AGES (3-18)
## The Universal Breath Lesson — If I Can Teach Kids, I Can Teach Anybody

*This is the lesson plan I use for youth basketball, but it applies to everyone. If I make a YouTube video on this or teach it anywhere else, this is the framework.*

## QUICK GLANCE BEFORE YOU START

```
THE LOOP:       OUT → PAUSE → in (small)
THE COUNTS:     6   →  2-3  → 2
THE PHRASE:     "Let it out, feel the calm, sip the air"
THE FORMULA:    FEEL IT → BREATHE → CHOOSE
```

## THE LESSON

### MINUTE 0-2: HOOK (Get Everyone)

**FOR THE LITTLE ONES (point to them, make it fun):**

"Who here has ever blown up a balloon? 🎈

What happens when you let the air OUT?
*[Make the sound: psssssshhhhhhh]*

It gets calm, right? Relaxed. Flat. Peaceful.

YOUR BODY is like that balloon. When you're mad or scared or nervous, you're all puffed up! Full of air! Tight!

But if you let the air OUT... *[demonstrate big exhale]*

Ahhhhh. You get calm."

**FOR THE OLDER ONES (eye contact with them):**

"And for the older players — you know that feeling when someone gets in your face, or you miss a big shot, or you're about to take a free throw with everyone watching?

Your brain gets HIJACKED. You react before you can think.

The best players — LeBron, Jordan, Kobe — they have the same brain as you. Same hijack system. But they know the cheat code.

It's free. You already have it.

**It's your breath.**"

---

### MINUTE 2-4: THE SCIENCE (Simple for all)

**SAY THIS (with big gestures):**

"Here's the secret. Super simple.

**Breathing OUT is the magic.**

Watch:

*[Big exhale, 6 counts, visible shoulders dropping]*

OUT... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...

*[Pause, peaceful face]*

Now I PAUSE... feel that calm... that's the good stuff...

*[Small quick inhale]*

Then a small sip of air in... just a little...

**That's it. That's the whole thing.**

OUT long... PAUSE... sip in.

*[Do it once more]*

See how my shoulders dropped? See how I got calm?

**The OUT breath is the reset button.**

---

**FOR LITTLE ONES, add:**

"It's like when you blow bubbles! You blow OUT nice and slow to make the best bubble. Then you wait... then you get a little more air. That's it!"

**FOR OLDER ONES, add:**

"Here's why it works — when you breathe out long, your brain thinks 'we're safe.' Your heart slows down. Your muscles relax. You can THINK again. The small inhale keeps you calm — you're not gulping air like you're drowning. Just enough. That's control."

---

### MINUTE 4-7: THE PRACTICE (Everyone together)

**SAY THIS:**

"Okay everybody, let's do it together. Sit up tall. Hands on your belly if you want.

We're gonna do THREE breaths. Ready?

**FIRST — PUSH ALL THE AIR OUT:**

OUT... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...
*[Mouth open, push it all out]*

**NOW PAUSE... feel that empty calm...**
*[2-3 seconds, peaceful]*

You have no air right now. But you're okay. You're calm. Feel that?

**NOW SIP — tiny breath in:**

In... 2... *[through nose, small]*

**AND OUT AGAIN...**

OUT... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...

**PAUSE... feel it...**

In... 2...

*[One more round]*

**LAST ONE... make it good...**

OUT... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...

PAUSE... this is your calm place... this is your power...

In... 2...

**Good!** How do you feel? Different? Calmer?"

---

**FOR TINY KIDS, make it a game:**

"Let's be balloons!

First we're all puffed up and crazy! *[puff up cheeks, tense]*

Now let the air out slowwwwly... *[pssssshhhhhh]*

Now we're flat and peaceful... *[relax, pause]*

Now just a tiny bit of air... *[small sip]*

Again!"

---

### MINUTE 7-9: WHEN TO USE IT (Connect to their life)

**SAY THIS:**

"Here's when you use this:

🏀 **Before a free throw:**
One big breath OUT. Pause. Then shoot.

😤 **When someone makes you mad:**
Before you say ANYTHING — breathe OUT first. Pause. THEN decide what to do.

😢 **After you make a mistake:**
Breathe OUT. Let the mistake GO with the air. Pause. Next play.

😰 **When you're nervous or scared:**
Breathe OUT. Find that calm pause. Then go.

---

**FOR LITTLE ONES:**

"When your brother or sister makes you SO MAD... *[puff up]*

Before you hit or yell... you go:

OUT... *[big exhale]* ...pause... okay now I can think.

It's your superpower!"

---

**FOR OLDER ONES:**

"Real talk — this is how you don't do stuff you regret.

When you feel that heat rising, that's your old brain trying to take over. The breath is how you take back control.

And here's the other thing — **the small inhale matters.**

You don't need a huge gulp of air. That actually makes you MORE stressed. Just a sip. Do more with less. That's what the pros do. They stay calm because they're not gasping — they're efficient.

Less air, same performance, way more control."

---

### MINUTE 9-10: THE CHALLENGE (Send them off)

**SAY THIS:**

"My challenge for you:

**ONE time this week** — when you feel something big — use it.

Mad? Scared? Nervous? Before you do ANYTHING:

**OUT... PAUSE... sip.**

Just once. See what happens.

---

Remember:

**OUT long** — let it all go

**PAUSE** — feel the calm (this is the good stuff)

**Sip in** — just enough

---

The phrase:

**'Let it out, feel the calm, sip the air.'**

Can everyone say that?

*[Have them repeat]*

**'Let it out, feel the calm, sip the air.'**

---

That's your superpower.

Free. Always with you.

**When pressure hits — breathe OUT.**

Any questions?"
