## THE SCRIPT (Reference — Don't Read Word-for-Word)

```
SECTION 1: OPENING (NYC View + Voice)

[Camera on NYC skyline. Your voice over.]

"Let me ask you something.

Your heart and your liver...
Do they fight each other?

Does your heart say 'I'm better than you, liver'?
Does your liver say 'Nah, I'm more important'?

No. That would be insane.

They're both part of the same body.
They both serve the same purpose.
They cooperate."

---

SECTION 2: THE QUESTION (Start Whiteboard)

[Cut to whiteboard. Draw the body with heart and liver.]

"But what if one day... your liver forgot?

What if your liver woke up and thought:
'Wait... why am I working for this body?
I should keep the nutrients for MYSELF.
I'm gonna grow bigger.
Take more blood.
Stop serving. Start taking.'

[Draw the cancer cell — growing, spreading]

What would we call that?

Cancer.

Cancer is just... a cell that forgot
it was part of something bigger."

---

SECTION 3: THE SHIFT (Continue Whiteboard)

[Draw the universe circle with stars and planets]

"Now... what if I told you
that the universe is like a body?

[Label as you draw]

Galaxies are like organ systems.
Stars are like organs.
Planets are like cells.

And we...
We're like the cells with consciousness.
We're the cells that can CHOOSE.

Choose to serve.
Or choose to extract.

Choose to remember.
Or choose to forget."

---

SECTION 4: THE TRUTH (Continue Whiteboard)

"What if God... is the body?

And every single thing in the universe—
every rock, every tree, every animal, every human—
is a piece of God?
An instance of God?
God doing a specific job?

The sun: God giving energy.
The tree: God breathing.
The ant: God building.
You: God... experiencing. Choosing. Loving.

All different jobs.
All one body.
All... God."

---

SECTION 5: THE PROBLEM (Continue Whiteboard)

[Draw the REMEMBER vs FORGET choice diagram]

"But here's the thing.

Some of us forgot.

We started thinking:
'I'm separate. I'm alone. I need to get mine.
My family first. My country first. Me first.'

We started extracting.
Taking more than we give.
Fighting other cells.
Building walls.
Hoarding.

[Point to the cancer cell drawing]

What's that called?

Cancer.

We became cancer.
In the body of God."

---

SECTION 6: THE SOLUTION (Face Reveal)

[CUT TO YOUR FACE. Eye contact. Real.]

"But here's the beautiful part.

Cancer can heal.
A cell can remember.

'Oh wait...
I'm part of something bigger.
Fighting them is fighting myself.
Helping them is helping myself.
We're all... one body.'

The moment you remember...
The cancer stops.
The healing begins.
The body thrives.

All it takes...
is remembering."

---

SECTION 7: THE CLOSE (NYC View)

[Cut back to NYC skyline. Voice over.]

"So next time you see someone different from you—
different skin, different country, different beliefs—

Remember:

Same body.
Different organ.

Same God.
Different costume.

You wouldn't fight your own liver.
Why fight your own brother?

[Pause. Let it breathe.]

We are one.
We just forgot.

Time to remember."
