**When to use:** Early sessions when kids are still learning names, or anytime to build energy

1. Stand in a circle
2. First person says their name and does a movement (jump, spin, arm wave, anything)
3. Whole team says the name back and copies the movement
4. Next person goes
5. Continue around the circle

**Variation for returning groups:** Person says name + "My move is..." and shows their signature basketball move. Team copies.

**Why it works:** Everyone gets seen. Everyone's style is celebrated. Builds memory and connection.

### Activity 3: Rhythm Dribbling
**Time:** 8-10 minutes
**When to use:** Warm-up, after stretching

**How to do it:**
1. Everyone gets a ball, spreads out
2. Leader starts a slow, steady dribble rhythm — BOOM... BOOM... BOOM...
3. Everyone matches the rhythm exactly
4. Leader gradually speeds up — team stays together
5. Leader slows down — team stays together
6. Leader STOPS (holds ball) — everyone must stop at same moment
7. Repeat with different rhythms

**Add challenge:** Leader closes eyes. Team must stay in rhythm without visual cues.

**Why it works:** Teaches listening. Builds team awareness. Shows how rhythm connects us.

### Activity 4: Mirror Dribbling (Partners)
**Time:** 5-7 minutes
**When to use:** Warm-up or skill stations

**How to do it:**
1. Pair up, face each other, each person has a ball
2. One person is the "leader," one is the "mirror"
3. Leader dribbles — high, low, left hand, right hand, between legs
4. Mirror copies EXACTLY, in real-time
5. Switch roles after 2 minutes

**Why it works:** Builds focus. Teaches reading body language. Prepares them to read defenders.

## SKILL STATION ACTIVITIES (Use during 2-hour skill block)

---

### Activity 5: One Move Mastery
**Time:** 15-20 minutes per rotation
**When to use:** Skill stations

**How to do it:**
1. Each kid picks ONE move they want to master (crossover, hesitation, spin, etc.)
2. They practice ONLY that move for the entire station time
3. Coach gives feedback on small adjustments
4. End of station: Each kid demonstrates their move to the group
5. Group gives encouragement (not critique)

**Key phrases to use:**
- "Simple becomes beautiful when you master it"
- "Do it 100 times and your body will remember forever"
- "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast"

**Why it works:** Fights the urge to be flashy. Builds real skill. Celebrates depth over breadth.

### Activity 6: Breath Shooting
**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**When to use:** Shooting station

**How to do it:**
1. Line up at free throw line (or closer for younger kids)
2. Before each shot, take ONE deep breath — in through nose, out through mouth
3. Shoot on the exhale
4. Don't rush to the next shot — reset, breathe, shoot
5. Count makes, but emphasize the PROCESS over the number

**Coach says:** "Your breath is your reset button. Nervous? Breathe. Missed the last shot? Breathe. Big moment? Breathe."

**Why it works:** Connects breath to performance. Builds a tool they'll use in games and life.

---

### Activity 7: Partner Passing Flow
**Time:** 10 minutes
**When to use:** Passing station

**How to do it:**
1. Partners stand 10-15 feet apart
2. Pass back and forth — chest pass, bounce pass, any pass
3. The rule: Find a RHYTHM without speaking
4. No words. Just passes. Let the rhythm emerge.
5. Once rhythm is established, slowly increase speed while keeping rhythm
6. If rhythm breaks, slow down and rebuild

**Add challenge:** Close eyes for a few passes (trust drill)

**Why it works:** Teaches nonverbal communication. Builds trust. Shows that flow happens when you stop forcing.

---

### Activity 8: "Help!" Drill
**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**When to use:** Teamwork station

**How to do it:**
1. Set up 3v3 or 4v4 half-court
2. Offense tries to score, defense tries to stop
3. Special rule: Any time a defender gets beat, they yell "HELP!"
4. Nearest teammate MUST come help
5. If they don't help, other team gets the ball

**Debrief questions:**
- "How did it feel to ask for help?"
- "How did it feel to BE the help?"
- "What happens when no one helps?"

**Why it works:** Normalizes asking for help. Shows that helping others helps the whole team.

**When to use:** Scrimmage time, especially good for inclusive/adaptive groups

**How to do it:**
1. Play to a set score (like 15 points)
