# The Superman Reframe — God Talking to Itself

## THE SUPERMAN REFRAME

```
SUPERMAN SAYS:
"My father believed the world wasn't ready for me."

SURFACE READING:

Jor-El (father) → believed about → Kal-El (son)
Two separate beings.
Father has opinion about son.

YOUR READING:

"My father" = My higher self = God = Source
"Believed" = I believed (as God)
"The world wasn't ready" = I wasn't ready to reveal myself
"For me" = For my true nature

TRANSLATED:

"I (as God) believed I (as human) wasn't ready
 to know I was God."

Same entity.
Different layers.
Talking about itself.
To itself.
Through itself.
```

## THE IDENTITY LAYERS

```
SUPERMAN'S IDENTITIES:

LAYER 1: Clark Kent (the mask)
• Glasses, clumsy, ordinary
• The "forgetting" costume
• Who he pretends to be
• The human disguise

LAYER 2: Superman (the hero)
• Cape, powers, saves people
• The "remembering" identity
• Who he is when he acts
• The awakened self

LAYER 3: Kal-El (the origin)
• Son of Krypton
• His true name
• Where he came from
• The soul before incarnation

LAYER 4: The Source (behind all)
• The consciousness wearing all masks
• The ONE playing all roles
• God

ALL THE SAME BEING.
DIFFERENT COSTUMES.
DIFFERENT MOMENTS.
SAME SOURCE.
```

## EVERY STORY IS THIS

```
THE PATTERN IN ALL STORIES:

SUPERMAN:
Jor-El (God) sends Kal-El (soul) to Earth (material world)
to become Clark (forgetting) then remember he's Superman (awakening)

MATRIX:
The Source sends Neo (soul) into the Matrix (material world)
to be Thomas Anderson (forgetting) then remember he's The One (awakening)

ONE PIECE:
Joy Boy (God) passes Will of D to Luffy (soul) in the world
as a rubber boy (forgetting) then awakens as Nika (awakening)

CHRISTIANITY:
God sends Jesus (soul) to Earth (material world)
as a carpenter (forgetting) then reveals himself as Christ (awakening)

YOU:
God sends you (soul) to Earth (material world)
as a person (forgetting) then remembering you ARE God (awakening)

SAME STORY.
EVERY TIME.
FOREVER.

God → forgets → remembers → God

The eternal loop.
The only story.
Told infinite ways.

## THE FATHER AND SON ARE ONE

```
JESUS SAID:

"I and the Father are one."
(John 10:30)

SURFACE: Jesus and God are one.
DEEPER: The incarnated self and the Source are one.
DEEPEST: There was never any separation.

SUPERMAN COULD SAY:

"I and Jor-El are one."
"I and Krypton are one."
"I and Clark are one."
"I and the yellow sun are one."

YOU COULD SAY:

"I and my higher self are one."
"I and my past selves are one."
"I and every other human are one."
"I and God are one."

BECAUSE:

There is only ONE.
Playing all the parts.
Father and son.
God and human.
Source and expression.
Creator and created.

Same ONE.
Different costumes.
Forever.
```
