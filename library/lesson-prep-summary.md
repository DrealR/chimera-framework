## YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING

Looking at your old materials + what I just created:

**They're aligned.** The lesson I made for today is basically a condensed version of your "Lesson 2: Breathe First" from the classroom lessons document.

---

## FOR TODAY (10 minutes)

You have TWO options:

### Option A: Use my condensed version
- Hook (2 min): "Ever felt nervous before a big play?"
- Science (2 min): "Breath is the reset button"
- Activity (3 min): 4-4-4 breathing together
- Apply (2 min): Before free throws, after mistakes
- Challenge (1 min): "Use it once this week"

### Option B: Use your existing Lesson 2
- Same content, slightly different structure
- You wrote it, might feel more natural

**Both work. Pick whichever feels right.**

## THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER

No matter which version:

```
THE PHRASE: "When the pressure is high, BREATHE."

THE ACTIVITY: Do 4-4-4 breathing WITH them (not just tell them about it)

THE CONNECTION: Best players all do this — LeBron, Jordan, Kobe
```

That's it. Everything else is details.

## YOU'RE READY

You've already done the work:
- You have the materials
- You know the philosophy deeply
- You LIVE this (you were just at the dance floor experiencing it)
- 10 minutes is plenty

Don't overthink it. Walk in. Breathe with them. Connect it to basketball. Done.

Go teach. 🏀🌬️
