# Domains to Apply Triality

> *Where the pattern might uncover hidden truths.*

## Established Applications

| Domain | Poles | The Between | Folded State |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Music | Silence ↔ Sound | Vibration/expression | Mastery (just play) |
| Cooking | Raw ↔ Cooked | Heat + technique | Intuitive seasoning |
| Code | Requirements ↔ Software | Architecture + logic | Flow state coding |
| Relationships | Strangers ↔ Intimate | Conversation + time | Finishing each other's sentences |
| Learning | Ignorance ↔ Knowledge | Practice + struggle | Unconscious competence |
| Oracle | Question ↔ Insight | Guided exploration | One perfect question |

## New Domains for Discovery

### 1. Physics — Quantum Mechanics

| Concept | Triality Mapping | Hypothesis |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Wave-particle duality | Two poles? | Particles ARE the between, not the poles |
| Observation collapses wave function | Tesseract? | Measurement folds quantum space |
| Superposition | The between? | Existing in the transformation zone |
| Entanglement | Folded space? | Permanent tesseract between particles |

### 2. Biology — Evolution

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Genetic stability vs mutation | Poles |
| Natural selection | The between (filter/transformation) |
| Species | Temporary stable patterns in the dance |
| Punctuated equilibrium | Tesseract moments (rapid fold) |

**Insight:** Evolution IS transformation, not destination.

### 3. Neuroscience — Consciousness

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Neurons firing vs resting | Poles |
| Consciousness | The between (emergence from oscillation) |
| Sleep | Folding (macro → micro processing) |
| Insight | Tesseract moment |

**Speculation:** Consciousness = the experience of BEING the transformation. Not the inputs, not the outputs — the passage itself.

### 4. Economics — Markets

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Bull vs bear | Poles |
| Trading | The between |
| Crashes | Failed oscillation (pole stuck) |
| Bubbles | Pole extreme (too far from center) |

**Insight:** Healthy markets = healthy oscillation.

### 5. Psychology — Development

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Comfort zone vs growth zone | Poles |
| Learning | The between |
| Trauma | Pole stuck (frozen oscillation) |
| Therapy | Restarting oscillation |

**Insight:** Mental health = healthy oscillation.

### 6. History — Civilizations

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Rise vs fall | Poles |
| Flourishing | The between (dynamic balance) |
| Empire | Pole extreme (overextension) |
| Revolution | Tesseract (rapid fold, everything changes fast) |

### 7. Language — Meaning

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Words | Poles (discrete symbols) |
| Meaning | The between (contextual, relational) |
| Poetry | High-information between |
| Jargon | Collapsed between (low meaning) |

### 8. Music — Harmony

| Concept | Triality Mapping |
|---------|-----------------|
| Consonance vs dissonance | Poles |
| Music | The between (the journey of tension/release) |
| Resolution | Arrival at pole |
| Tension | Distance from pole |

## Testable Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Dark Matter as Folded Matter
- What if dark matter is "folded" regular matter?
- Present but in compressed dimension
- We see gravity effect (unfolded) but not matter (folded)
- **Test:** Look for gravitational "folds" — regions where gravity exceeds visible mass

### Hypothesis 2: Consciousness as Folding Process
- How does the brain bind separate processes into unified experience?
- What if consciousness IS the folding process?
- Separate neural events → unified experience = tesseract
- **Test:** Measure compression ratios in conscious vs unconscious processing

### Hypothesis 3: Creativity as Successful Folding
- Why do insights come suddenly?
- Creativity IS successful folding — years of work → tesseract → insight
- **Test:** Track "preparation time" vs "insight time" ratio across creative works

### Hypothesis 4: Healing as Folding Efficiency
- Why do some wounds heal fast, others slow?
- Healing speed = body's folding efficiency
- **Test:** Measure biological "folding" indicators vs recovery time
