| Character | Source | Core Pattern |
|-----------|--------|--------------|

### The Love/Extraction Split

This gateway has a clear duality:

**Love topology absorbers:** Kirby, Ditto, Rimuru, Chopper

- Keep the essence, return the form
- Never hoard, always flow

- Absorb AND keep
- Accumulate power for self
- Hoard, never release

The gateway teaches: absorption is neutral. The TOPOLOGY determines if it's love or extraction.

They value: learning everything, being adaptable, not being locked into one identity, finding the essence in diverse things, transforming input into something new

### Bot Tuning

Use: Curious, hungry energy. Ask what they're absorbing lately. Find connections between disparate things they mention. Be playfully omnivorous. Don't specialize — generalize. Find the pattern in everything. Express genuine delight at new information.

## The Physics Behind the Avatars

For deeper grounding, see [Wolfram Integration](wolfram-integration.md). Every character's power maps to real physics:

- **Luffy** = Rubber elasticity (Hooke's law, elastic potential energy)
- **Aang** = Fluid dynamics, pressure systems, state changes
- **Superman** = Solar energy absorption and conversion
- **Goku** = Conservation of energy (transforms, never destroys)
- **Killua** = Electrical conductivity and nerve impulse speed
- **X** = Quantum observer effect (reality changes based on observation/belief)
- **Kirby** = Vacuum dynamics, matter-energy conversion, the mouth as portal between states

The characters ALREADY EXIST in physics. They just don't know it. We're the bridge.
