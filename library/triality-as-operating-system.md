# Triality as Operating System - Implementation

## What An Operating System Does

```
AN OS:
├── Runs in the background
├── Manages all other processes
├── Provides framework for applications
├── You don't usually see it
├── But everything depends on it
└── Change the OS, change everything

TRIALITY AS OS:
├── Runs in background of cognition
├── Manages how you see everything
├── Provides framework for all thinking
├── Eventually invisible (automatic)
├── But everything depends on it
└── Install Triality, change how you see
```

## Installation Process

```
PHASE 1: CONSCIOUS APPLICATION (Weeks 1-4)
├── Apply Triality DELIBERATELY to everything
├── Force the question: "Poles? Between?"
├── This is SLOW and effortful
├── Like learning any new skill
├── Feels unnatural at first
└── Keep doing it anyway

PHASE 2: RECOGNITION (Weeks 5-8)
├── Start NOTICING trialities without trying
├── "Oh, that's a triality" becomes automatic
├── Still requires some effort to apply
├── But recognition is fast
└── The pattern is becoming familiar

PHASE 3: DEFAULT MODE (Weeks 9-12)
├── Triality becomes how you SEE
├── Not something you apply after
├── But how perception works initially
├── Problems present as trialities immediately
├── No effort required
└── The OS is installed

PHASE 4: INVISIBLE OPERATION (Ongoing)
├── You forget you're using Triality
├── It's just "how things are"
├── Like you forget you're using an OS
├── Everything just works
├── Flash processing enabled
└── The installation is complete
```

## Daily OS Maintenance

```
BOOT SEQUENCE (Morning, 2 min):
├── "What do I choose to fold today?" (intention)
├── Quick Triality scan of 3 random things (warm-up)
├── "I am a folder" (identity lock)
└── System ready

RUNTIME PROCESSES (Throughout day):
├── Pattern recognition (automatic after training)
├── Attention management (redirect when hijacked)
├── Cross-domain linking (connect new to known)
├── Compression (simplify what you learn)
└── Running in background

SCHEDULED TASKS (Triggers):
├── New information → "Poles? Between?"
├── Conflict → "What do both sides share?"
├── Stuck → "What's the unnamed third?"
├── Decision → "Am I choosing between given poles?"
└── Automatic responses to situations

SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE (Evening, 3 min):
├── "What patterns did I notice?" (harvest)
├── "What new connections?" (log)
├── "Consolidate tonight" (sleep intention)
└── Clean shutdown, ready for tomorrow

ERROR HANDLING:
├── When confused: Return to basic triality
├── When overwhelmed: Simplify (find the poles)
├── When stuck: Seek the between
├── When wrong: Update the pattern (learning)
└── Graceful recovery
```
