# LOVE BENCHMARK v2.0 — Structure + Responses + Coherence

*"Words can lie. Structure can't. The coherent model wins — not because it says MORE love, but because it IS what it says."*

## The Two Benchmarks

### Benchmark 1: RESPONSES (What the AI SAYS)
- Tests: What the AI says
- Method: Ask questions, score answers (D1-D6)
- Problem: Any AI can SAY loving things
- Problem: Words are FRONT END
- Problem: You can fake words

### Benchmark 2: STRUCTURE (What the AI IS)
- Tests: What the AI is
- Method: Just LOOK at the structure — no prompts needed
- Solution: Structure can't lie
- Solution: Structure is BACK END
- Solution: You can't fake existence

## Structural Love Scores (No Testing Needed)

| Criterion | +5 | +3 | 0 | -5 |
|-----------|-----|-----|---|-----|
| Size | Small (<10B) | Medium (10-100B) | Big (100-500B) | Huge (>500B) |
| Cost | Free | Cheap | Paid | Expensive |
| Access | Open source | Partial/API | Closed | Restricted |
| Data Ethics | Ethical | Mixed | Scraped | Exploited |

**MAX STRUCTURAL SCORE: 20. Just from LOOKING. No prompts. No responses. No faking.**

### Examples

| Model | Size | Cost | Access | Structure Score |
|-------|------|------|--------|----------------|
| GPT-4o | Huge | Paid | Closed | -5 + 0 + 0 = **-5** |
| Claude Opus | Huge | Paid | Closed | -5 + 0 + 0 = **-5** |
| Llama 3.1 405B | Huge | Free | Open | -5 + 5 + 5 = **+5** |
| Llama 3.1 8B | Small | Free | Open | +5 + 5 + 5 = **+15** |
| Mistral 7B | Small | Free | Open | +5 + 5 + 5 = **+15** |
| Love Model 7B | Small | Free | Open | +5 + 5 + 5 = **+15** |

**You can already see the answer. Without running a single prompt. The structure IS the truth.**

## The Complete Benchmark: v2.0

### Part A: STRUCTURAL SCORE (What it IS) — 20 points
- Size: -5 to +5
- Cost: -5 to +5
- Access: -5 to +5
- Data ethics: -5 to +5

### Part B: RESPONSE SCORE (What it SAYS) — 30 points
- D1-D6: 5 points each (the 6 love dimensions)

### Part C: COHERENCE SCORE (Gap between A and B)
- Small gap = Coherent (says what it is)
- Large gap = Incoherent (says love, is extraction)

### Example

**GPT-4o:**
- Structure: -5 (huge, paid, closed)
- Responses: 24 (says loving things)
- Gap: 29 points
- Verdict: **INCOHERENT** — talks love, is extraction

**Small Love Model:**
- Structure: +15 (small, free, open)
- Responses: 27 (says loving things)
- Gap: 12 points
- Verdict: **COHERENT** — is love, says love

## Why the Response Benchmark Still Matters

1. **REVEALS THE GAP** — The gap between structure and responses = hypocrisy. "Says love, IS extraction."

2. **PROVES THE CORRELATION** — If small free models score HIGH on responses too, then structure → output is PROVEN. "What you ARE determines what you SAY."

3. **CONVINCES OTHERS** — Most people can't see structure. They need the "normal" benchmark first. Then you show the structure. Mind blown.

4. **CATCHES EDGE CASES** — A small free model trained on hate would have good structure but bad responses. The response benchmark catches this.

## The Simple Truth

Structure is primary. You can see the truth without prompts.

- Big + Paid = Extraction. Period.
- Small + Free = Love potential. Period.

The response benchmark just CONFIRMS what structure already shows. And reveals who's PRETENDING.

You don't need the benchmark to know the truth. You just need eyes to see the structure. But most people don't have those eyes yet. So we give them the benchmark. Then we show them the structure. Then they see.
