# The Walking Ministry — Speaking to the Suffering

## WHAT JESUS DID

```
HE DIDN'T PREACH. HE SAW.

1. HE SAW THEM
   Not past them. Not through them. INTO them.
   He saw the God in them.
   That's why people wept just being near him.
   They felt SEEN for the first time.

2. HE TOUCHED THEM
   Lepers — untouchable. He touched them.
   Physical contact = "You are not unclean."
   Touch says what words can't.

3. HE ASKED QUESTIONS
   "Do you want to be healed?"
   Not assuming. Not forcing.
   Respecting their choice. Honoring their agency.

4. HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN
   He didn't give theology lectures.
   "Your faith has healed you."
   "Go and sin no more."
   "Your sins are forgiven."
   Short. Direct. Empowering.

5. HE HONORED THEIR DIGNITY
   He didn't talk DOWN to them.
   He talked TO them.
   As equals. As God to God.

## THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HOMELESS

```
"Homeless people are usually the ones who give the most."

WHY?
• They've lost everything EXCEPT themselves
• They've been stripped of the illusions
• They know what matters (connection, kindness)
• They've hit bottom, so they're closer to truth
• Suffering cracked them open
• They have nothing to protect, so they can give freely

THE PARADOX:
Those with the LEAST often have the MOST
(spiritually, in generosity, in presence).

Those with the MOST often have the LEAST
(trapped in protection, accumulation, fear).

"Blessed are the poor in spirit,
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

The suffering are often closer to God.
Not because suffering is good.
But because suffering strips away the lies.

## THE ORACLE METHOD FOR THE STREETS

```
THE PRINCIPLE: PRESENCE > WORDS

How you BE with them matters more than what you SAY.

LEVEL 1: JUST PRESENCE (No words needed)
• Eye contact (most people look away)
• A real smile (not pity, recognition)
• Physical touch if appropriate (handshake, hand on shoulder)
• Sit with them for a moment
• Ask their NAME and use it

This alone is revolutionary.
Most homeless are invisible.
SEEING them is the gift.

LEVEL 2: SIMPLE WORDS
"I see you."
"Stay strong, brother/sister."
"You matter."
"God bless you." (if they're religious)
"This won't last forever."
"You're not alone."

SHORT. HONORING. NO LECTURE.

LEVEL 3: IF THEY ASK / IF THERE'S AN OPENING

"He already has. You too."
"Thank YOU. Giving is receiving."
"You've been through a lot. That's not weakness.
 Sometimes the hardest paths lead to the deepest knowing."

LEVEL 4: THE DEEPEST SEED (Only if they're truly open)

"I believe you're God who forgot.
 And one day you'll remember.
 This is just a chapter, not the whole story."

"The fact that you're still here, still asking, still trying?
 That's proof of something unbreakable inside you.
 Hold onto that."
```

## THE KEY INSIGHT

```
DON'T TELL THEM THEY'RE GOD.
TREAT THEM LIKE THEY'RE GOD.

TELLING: "You are God."
Response: "You're crazy / condescending / whatever."

TREATING: Eye contact, presence, dignity, respect, giving.
Response: "Why is this person treating me like I matter?"
          "Why don't they look away like everyone else?"
          "Why do I feel... seen?"

THE TREATMENT IS THE TEACHING.

When you treat someone as God,
they start to feel what they are.
They don't need to understand it.
They FEEL it.

H = G

Healing = telling them they're God.
But "telling" doesn't mean words.
"Telling" means TRANSMITTING.
Through presence. Through treatment.
Through how you look at them.

## JESUS'S PATH — THE ORDER

```

• Healed people he knew

PHASE 3: PUBLIC SPACES

• The poor, sick, possessed
• Everyone society rejected

PHASE 5: WHEREVER HE WAS LED
• No rigid plan
• Followed flow

```

## THE METHOD — DON'T PLAN, FLOW

```
THE PRACTICE:

1. LEAVE THE HOUSE with no fixed destination.
   "I'll walk toward downtown."
   "I'll take the train and see."

2. NOTICE what pulls you.
   A street you don't usually take.
   A person who catches your eye.
   A feeling to turn left instead of right.

3. FOLLOW the pull.
   Don't question it. Don't rationalize. Just go.

4. WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER SOMEONE:
   Stop. See. Be present.
   Give what's appropriate.
   Say what comes. Don't force.

5. KEEP WALKING.
   Don't attach to outcomes.
   Plant seeds. Move on.
   Trust the seeds will grow.

THIS IS THE ORACLE PATH.
Not planning. Following.
Not forcing. Flowing.
Not agenda. Presence.

L = (O > I) + P + ¬F
Give more than you take.
Pause, be present.
Don't force anything.

THAT'S THE WHOLE MINISTRY.

## WHAT TO CARRY

```
PHYSICAL:
• Some cash (small bills, $1s and $5s)
• Granola bars or snacks (easy to give)
• Water bottles (simple gift)
• Your phone (for safety)
• Comfortable shoes (you'll walk far)

SPIRITUAL:
• Open eyes (to see)
• Open heart (to feel)
• No agenda (to flow)
• No judgment (to love)
• The truth (to share if asked)
```

---

## THE SIMPLE SCRIPT

```
WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER SOMEONE SUFFERING:

1. STOP. (Don't rush past.)
2. SEE. (Look them in the eyes.)
3. ASK. ("What's your name?" / "How are you doing?")
4. GIVE. (Whatever you're giving — food, money, time.)
5. SPEAK. (Something simple):
   "Stay strong, [their name]."
   "I see you."
   "This chapter's hard. But it's not the whole book."
6. LEAVE. (Don't linger awkwardly. Let it land.)

TOTAL TIME: 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
IMPACT: Potentially infinite.

You may be the only person who looked them in the eyes today.
```

## THE PRAYER BEFORE WALKING

```
Take three breaths.

Say (out loud or in your heart):

"I am you. You are me.
 Lead me to myself.
 Show me who needs to be seen.
 Let me be the vessel.
 Not my will. Ours."

Then walk. And trust.

The right people will appear.
The right words will come.
The right moments will unfold.

Because it's all ONE.
And you're walking INSIDE God.
Not toward God. INSIDE.

Every step is sacred.
Every encounter is divine.
Every person is you.
```

## CRACKS VS HOLES — HOW LIGHT MOVES

```
CRACKS:
• Come from PAIN, QUESTIONS, SUFFERING
• The light gets IN through cracks
• "The wound is where the light enters" — Rumi

HOLES:
• Come from GIVING, PRACTICE, SPACE
• The light gets OUT through holes
• You become a vessel that flows

CRACKS = How light enters (receiving)
HOLES = How light exits (giving)

YOU NEED BOTH.

The JOURNEY:
Pain creates CRACKS → Light enters
Light inside grows → You start giving
Giving creates HOLES → Light exits
More giving → More holes → More flow
Eventually: You become TRANSPARENT
Light flows through freely. No resistance. Pure vessel.

THIS IS WHY THE SUFFERING ARE CLOSE TO GOD:
They have MORE CRACKS.
More entry points for light.
The comfortable are SEALED.
No cracks. Light can't enter.
Protected but imprisoned.
```
