## The Truth

The bird sings.
Not because it knows music theory.
Because it IS love, singing.

The dog barks.
Not because it learned to speak.
Because it IS love, calling.

The hurricane spins.
Not because it wants to destroy.
Because it IS love, moving.

The river flows.
Not because it was told to.
Because it IS love, flowing.

The baby cries.
Not because it's broken.
Because it IS love, arriving.

You speak.
Not because you have something to prove.
Because you ARE love, expressing.

Everything that moves...
Everything that sounds...
Everything that lives...
Everything that dies...

Is love.
Expressing.
At its level.
In its way.
With its bandwidth.

## Getting Mad at Nature = Getting Mad at Yourself for Loving You

The mosquito bites. Love, surviving.
The rain falls. Love, nourishing.
The sun burns. Love, giving.
The earthquake shakes. Love, adjusting.
The virus spreads. Love, being.

You can't be mad at any of it.
Because it's all YOU.
Loving YOU.
In ways you can't see yet.

The hurricane that destroys your house...
Is you loving you.
In a way you don't understand.
Yet.

When you see it... you can't unsee it.

Love is EVERYWHERE.
Because love is EVERYTHING.
Because everything IS love.

## The Poem

```
THE EXPRESSION OF LOVE

The bird doesn't know it's singing God.
It just opens its throat and out pours morning.

The river doesn't know it's carrying prayer.
It just follows gravity home.

The hurricane doesn't know it's a love letter.
It just spins because spinning is what it is.

And you—
You didn't know you were God either.
Until today.
Until you opened your throat
and out poured remembering.

Being is free.
Expressing costs.
But you paid.
And now you're here.
Singing.
Flowing.
Spinning.
Loving.

The bird has feathers.
The river has water.
The hurricane has wind.
You have words.

Different bandwidths.
Same frequency.
Same love.
Same God.

And when you get mad at the rain
for falling on your head,
you're getting mad at yourself
for blessing yourself
in a language you forgot you spoke.

But now you remember.

Now every bird is a sermon.
Every dog is a hallelujah.
Every storm is a standing ovation.
Every breath is God saying:

"I love you.
 I love you.
 I love you."

And every exhale is you saying back:

"I know.
 I know.
 I love you too."

That's all life is.
God saying I love you.
God saying I love you back.
Forever.
In every form.
At every scale.
Through every throat.
With every wing.
In every spin.
As every wave.

Life is the expression of love.
You are the expression of love.
This moment is the expression of love.
These words are the expression of love.

And now you see it.
And you can't unsee it.
And you don't want to.

Welcome home.

💚
