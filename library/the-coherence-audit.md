# The Coherence Audit

*Most people don't want to look. The audit isn't to shame. It's to align.*

---

## Part 1: Personal Incoherences

### Things To Examine In Yourself

| Pattern | Question To Ask | Extraction or Flow? |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **The "Perfect Girl" story** | Are you still holding a Disney narrative of what love should look like? | Extraction (love as achievement to obtain) |
| **Millionaire goal** | Is the number still the goal, or is flow the goal? | Extraction (number accumulation) |
| **Comparison mind** | Do you still compare your path to friends' paths? | Extraction (status measurement) |
| **Guilt/shame** | Do you feel like you "failed" by changing course? | Extraction lens on yourself |
| **Waiting to be ready** | Are you delaying living the philosophy until conditions are perfect? | Control (not flow) |
| **Isolation vs Cocoon** | Are you healing or hiding from people? | Honest question only you can answer |

---

### Your Body (The Stomach)

| Consumption | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| What you eat | Why? For what goal? Aesthetic? Performance? Who told you that you needed it? |
| What your body rejects | Are you listening? Or overriding? |

**The CHIMERA lens:**

Your body says YES or NO. Flow would be: Eat what your body says YES to. Stop forcing what it rejects.

That's extraction thinking applied to your own body when you override it.

---

### Your Time

| Activity | Flow or Extraction? |
|----------|---------------------|
| Work for money | Neutral — money flowing through, but is it draining you? |
| Philosophy work | Flow — building the map |
| Skill practice | Flow — building for giving |
| Scrolling/consuming | Depends — learning or escaping? |
| Waiting | Are you PRESENT in waiting or anxious for it to end? |

---

## Part 2: Relationship Incoherences

### With Family

| Question |
|----------|
| Are you PRESENT with them or physically there but mentally elsewhere? |
| Are you serving them or just occupying space? |
| Are you being honest about your journey or performing "I'm fine"? |
| Do you see them as interruptions to your "real work" or as THE work? |

**Your family IS the training ground. Not the waiting room.**

---

### With Friends

| Question |
|----------|
| Are you avoiding them because it's hard to explain? |
| Are you judging them for still being "in the matrix"? |
| Can you love them WITHOUT needing them to understand? |

**Luffy doesn't need his crew to understand everything. He just loves them.**

---

### With Yourself

| Old Story | New Story (Flow) |
|-----------|------------------|
| "I failed" | "I learned and the chapter ended" |
| "I wasted years" | "I learned for years" |
| "I should be further along" | "I'm exactly where I need to be" |
| "I need to figure it all out" | "I need to flow and trust" |

Do you actually BELIEVE the new stories? Or do the old ones still run in the background?

---

## Part 3: Money Incoherences

| Question |
|----------|
| Do you still feel scarcity? ("I need to make sure I have enough") |
| Do you still feel the pull to accumulate? |
| Do you trust that flow will provide? Or is that just words? |
| Can you give freely right now? Or are you waiting until you have "enough"? |

**The Honeydew Test:**

You say 95% flows through, 5% stays. Are you living that NOW? Or is that a future ideal?

Honeydew Economics doesn't start when you're rich. It starts NOW. With whatever flows through you TODAY.

---

## Part 4: Consumption Incoherences

| Category | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Food** | Are you eating to nourish or to fill/perform? |
| **Music** | Aligned playlist — but do you cheat? What else sneaks in? |
| **Video** | Aligned content — but what else? Anything extraction-based? |
| **Information** | Are you APPLYING what you learn or just consuming more? |
| **People's opinions** | Do you still let others' confusion affect your peace? |

**The Input/Output Ratio:**

> Input without output = hoarding
> Learning without practice = extraction of knowledge

Are you practicing the philosophy daily? Or studying it?

---

## Part 5: Systems You Still Use

| System | Extraction Level | Can You Reduce/Exit? |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Banking** | High | Crypto alternatives for some |
| **Smartphone** | Medium — attention extraction | Minimize apps |
| **Big Tech platforms** | High — data extraction | Alternatives exist |
| **Fast food** | High — health extraction | Cook more |
| **News/Media** | High — attention/fear extraction | Already avoiding? |

You can't exit ALL systems immediately. But which ones are you unconsciously still feeding?

---

## Part 6: Thought Patterns

### The Sneaky Ones That Might Still Run

| Pattern | Check |
|---------|-------|
| **Urgency** | "I need to figure this out FAST" — that's extraction pace |
| **Perfectionism** | "I need to get the philosophy RIGHT" — that's control, not flow |
| **Future-focus** | "When the time comes... when conditions align..." — not present |
| **Self-judgment** | "Why did I waste so much time" — extraction lens on yourself |
| **Need to be understood** | Wanting others to GET it — attachment to outcome |
| **Spiritual ego** | "I see what they don't see" — subtle superiority |

**Especially the last one.**

You can see the joke. You can see the matrix. But if that becomes "I'm awake and they're asleep" — that's ego wearing spiritual clothes.

Luffy doesn't think he's better than anyone. He just IS free. And loves everyone anyway.

## Part 7: The Daily Practice Check

| Practice | Consistent? |
|----------|-------------|
| Morning breath work | |
| Grounding (barefoot on earth) | |
| Heart coherence practice | |
| Skill practice (daily) | |
| Serving others (cooking, helping) | |
| Gratitude/presence practice | |
| Journaling/reflection | |
| Physical movement | |

Philosophy without practice = extraction of ideas.

## The Big Questions

1. **If conditions never changed, could you find peace?**
   (Or is peace conditional on the journey starting?)

2. **If you never "made it" by any external measure, would you still live this way?**
   (Or is there still a secret hope that flow will lead to success?)

3. **Can you be fully present TODAY — not as waiting room but as HOME?**

4. **Can you love others WITHOUT them understanding?**

5. **Is your body at peace right now? What is it telling you?**

6. **Are you flowing or planning to flow soon?**

---

## The Simple Lens

Every moment, ask:

> **Am I flowing or forcing?**
> **Am I present or escaping to future/past?**
> **Am I giving or accumulating?**
> **Am I trusting or controlling?**

That's the whole practice.
