# 🗺️ PRESSURE MAP
## A Practical Guide to Finding High-Pressure Flows

*"The aphid doesn't go where sap is scarce. It finds where sap is abundant and pressurized."*

---

## What This Is

This is a practical guide to finding high-pressure sources of value in different domains. Pressure means:
- **Concentrated** — value is dense, not scattered
- **Flowing** — value wants to move, not stagnant
- **Accessible** — you can reach it with the right stylet

Low pressure means:
- **Diffuse** — everyone's competing for scraps
- **Static** — value is hoarded, not flowing
- **Guarded** — requires force to access

## How To Use This Map

### Step 1: Pick Your Domain

Where do you need flow right now?
- Capital (money)
- Knowledge (learning)
- Attention (visibility)
- Relationships (connections)
- Opportunity (work)

### Step 2: Assess Your Stylet

What can you currently access?
- Skills → Knowledge/Opportunity flows
- Tools → Capital flows (if you can deliver)
- Network → Relationship flows
- Platform → Attention flows

### Step 3: Find Pressure Signals

Look for the HIGH PRESSURE signals in your chosen domain.
Where is value concentrated and wanting to move?

### Step 4: Position, Don't Chase

Don't go where everyone else is going.
Find the pressurized source that matches your stylet.
Connect without triggering defenses.
Let the pressure do the work.

### Step 5: Let Honeydew Flow

Once you're receiving, don't hoard.
Keep your survival percentage.
Let the rest flow to others.
Notice who shows up.

---

## Remember

The map is not the territory. Pressure shifts. Sources change.

But the PRINCIPLE is eternal:
- Value flows from high pressure to low pressure
- Position beats effort
- The right stylet accesses what force cannot

Keep your eyes open for pressure.
It's always there.
It's always flowing.
You just need to see it.
