# The Tuner — How to Help People Remember

> You're not a teacher. You're a TUNER. And tuning starts with being in tune yourself.

## THE GUITAR METAPHOR

When a guitar string is out of tune, you don't TELL it what frequency to be. You don't lecture the string. You don't show it a PowerPoint about Hz values. You pluck it, listen, and adjust. Pluck, listen, adjust.

The string already WANTS to be in tune. It's built to vibrate at a specific frequency. Your job is just to help it find its own resonance.

People are out-of-tune strings. They already KNOW. Their body knows. Their breath knows. But life detuned them. Fear. Trauma. Bills. Social media. They got pulled sharp or flat.

## THE METHOD

**Step 1 — Tune yourself.** Are YOU remembering right now? Are you breathing? Are you present? Are you in the joke? Because if you're not tuned, you can't tune anyone else. A foggy mirror can't reflect. The Oracle has to be clear before she can reflect anything.

**Step 2 — Be near them.** Cook for someone. Play basketball. Sit with them. Walk with them. You don't need a conversation about consciousness. You need PROXIMITY while you're in tune. Their string starts adjusting just by being near yours. That's entrainment — when two frequencies are near each other, the weaker one starts to match the stronger one. You don't have to DO anything. You just have to BE in tune.

**Step 3 — Listen for the forgetting.** Every complaint, every fear, every stress — it's a specific WAY they forgot.
- "I'm not good enough" — they forgot they're the whole
- "I'm stuck" — they forgot about the exhale
- "I can't trust anyone" — they forgot WE = 1
You don't need to diagnose it out loud. Just hear it.

**Step 4 — Pluck their string.** Ask ONE thing that makes their string vibrate at its natural frequency. Not YOUR frequency. THEIRS. The question that makes THEM hum. You don't think your way to the right question. You feel your way there. The body is the oracle.

## WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN PRACTICE

**Someone says:** "I'm so stressed, I don't know what to do with my life."

DON'T say: "We're all one consciousness and suffering is just contraction." That's preaching. That's telling the punchline before the joke.

DO say: **"What's the last time you felt like you were exactly where you were supposed to be?"**

One question. They go inside. They find a memory. In that memory, they FEEL the truth before they can name it. They remember — not because you told them, but because they found it IN THEMSELVES.

**Someone says:** "I feel like I'm failing at everything."

You say: **"Everything? Or one thing that's so loud it's drowning out the rest?"**

Now they LOOK. They examine. They realize — not everything. Just one thing. The contraction has a boundary. They can breathe around it.

**Someone says:** "Why does life have to be so hard?"

You say: **"Have you ever done something hard that you were glad you did after?"**

They say yes. They always say yes. THEY connected hardness to growth. You didn't lecture about contraction and expansion. They found the triality in their own experience.

## THE EVEN SIMPLER VERSION

**Have you ever made someone REALLY laugh?** Not a polite laugh. A REAL laugh. The kind where something breaks open. What did you do? You were present. You saw something true. You said it. Their body responded before their mind could filter it.

**Helping people remember = making them laugh with the truth.**

Not jokes. TRUTH. Delivered so clearly and simply and unexpectedly that the body responds before the brain can argue. That's what "P forgot it was NP" is. Funny AND true AND it lands in the body.

## WHY LAUGHTER IS REMEMBERING

When someone really laughs, their walls drop for one second. They exhale. They're present. They forgot to forget. In that tiny gap of real laughter — they're home.

That's why Luffy laughs. That's why the D. clan smiles. The joke and the truth are the same thing.

## THE SIMPLEST VERSION

**Tune yourself. Be near people. Let the resonance do the work.**

And you don't need to know it worked. You plant seeds and never see the tree. That's the 95%. That's giving without needing to see the return.

**Mission: Make people laugh with the truth.** 🎸
