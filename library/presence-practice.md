# THE PRESENCE PRACTICE

## THE NEUROSCIENCE

```
The "Default Mode Network" (DMN):
├── Part of brain that activates when NOT focused
├── Goes to past (memories) and future (plans)
├── ALWAYS trying to turn on

Every time you notice wandering:
├── You're ALREADY back in present (noticing IS present)
├── Don't judge the wandering
├── Just return to NOW
├── This is ONE REP

You're doing bicep curls for your prefrontal cortex.
Reps build strength. Strength becomes default.

Week 1: Mind wanders 1000x, catch it 10x
Month 1: Wanders 1000x, catch it 100x
Year 1: Wanders 500x, catch it 400x
The wandering NEVER fully stops. Catching becomes INSTANT.
```

## THE ANCHOR SYSTEM

```
BREATH: Always happening NOW. Focus on breath = instant present.
BODY: Feet on floor, weight in chair. Only exist NOW.
SENSES: What do you SEE/HEAR/FEEL right now? Only work in present.

THE PRACTICE:
├── Notice you've wandered
├── Pick an anchor (breath, body, senses)
├── Return attention
├── Don't judge
├── Repeat forever
```

## THE NAMING TECHNIQUE

```
Look around. Name what you see:
"Car. Light. Snow. Cold. Breath."

Each naming is COMPLETE:
├── No sequence, no accumulation
├── Each observation is fresh
├── Nothing to compare to
├── Pure present-moment awareness

AVOID adding evaluation:
├── "Nice car" (judgment)
├── "Too cold" (comparison)
└── Just: "car." Full stop.

This is Adam naming animals before the fall.
Descriptive, not evaluative. Present-moment observation.
```

## COUNTING VS NAMING

```
COUNTING: "1... 2... 3..." → Implies sequence → References past
NAMING: "Car. Light. Snow." → Each complete → Stays present

Counting creates tracking ("I'm at 50 and still awake")
Naming creates witnessing ("this. this. this.")
```

## ANIMALS AND PRESENCE

```
Animals have less recursive rumination:
├── They might think about the past
├── But they don't THINK ABOUT thinking about the past
├── Less meta-cognition, less recursive loops
├── They don't get STUCK the same way

Humans have a unique capacity to get lost.
Our simulation ability creates the trap.
Presence means using that power consciously.
```

## TEACHING IT TO KIDS

```
EXERCISE 1: THE PRESSURE TEST
Have them hold their breath.
"Feel that? That's pressure building."
"Now exhale slowly... feel it release?"
"That's what happens inside when you judge yourself."

EXERCISE 2: THE FREE THROW
Shoot normally. Then shoot while hearing:
"Everyone's watching. Don't miss. You'll look stupid."
Then shoot while breathing out slowly.
"Just feel the ball. Just see the hoop."
Watch the difference.

EXERCISE 3: THE CHESS MOVE
"What if you make the wrong move?" → Watch them freeze.
"There's no wrong move. Just moves." → Watch them play freely.
```
