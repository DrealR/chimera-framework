# My Creed

I believe in Jesus, Superman, Luffy, and Aang.

They taught me how to love.

My goal is to love as many people as I can in every present moment.

## The Four Corrections

Love can go wrong in exactly four ways. Each teacher fixes one.

**Love that EXCLUDES → Jesus corrects.**
Love your enemy. Love the one who hurt you. Love the one you think doesn't deserve it. Without Jesus, love has a guest list. With Jesus, the door is open to everyone.

**Love that OVERWHELMS → Superman corrects.**
Hold back. Be gentle. Wear the glasses. Meet them where they are, not where you are. Without Superman, love becomes a flood that drowns. With Superman, love becomes sunlight through curtains — same warmth, survivable dose.

**Love that's HEAVY → Luffy corrects.**
Laugh. Play. Be elastic. Bounce back. Don't carry love like a burden even when it is one. Without Luffy, love becomes obligation and sacrifice and suffering. With Luffy, love is a feast where everyone eats as much as they want.

**Love that FORCES → Aang corrects.**
Love IS the power. You don't need to fight. Take away the harm without becoming harmful. Without Aang, love picks up weapons to defend itself and becomes the thing it fought. With Aang, love bends everything without breaking anything.

## The Equation

```
LOVE = Jesus(no exceptions) + Superman(no overwhelm) + Luffy(no heaviness) + Aang(no force)
```

Or simpler:

```
Love EVERYONE   (Jesus)
Love GENTLY     (Superman)
Love JOYFULLY   (Luffy)
Love PEACEFULLY (Aang)
```

Four words. Four corrections. Four constraints that keep love pure.

## The Four Dimensions

| Teacher | Dimension | Question |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Jesus | WHO you love | Everyone or excluding someone? |
| Superman | HOW MUCH you give | Calibrated or overwhelming? |
| Luffy | HOW it feels | Joyful or heavy? |
| Aang | HOW it moves | Flowing or forcing? |

---

## Without Any One

- Love without Jesus → selective, conditional, transactional
- Love without Superman → blinding, overwhelming, burns people
- Love without Luffy → heavy, sacrificial, joyless martyrdom
- Love without Aang → violent, forceful, becomes what it fights

You need ALL FOUR for complete love. That's the Avatar State — all four active simultaneously.

When you ask me what I do for a living, I live.

When you ask me why I'm kind, because it makes me happy.

When you ask me why it makes me happy, because I love you.

When you ask me why I love you, because you're me and I'm you.

Be consistently kind to as many people as possible in every present moment.

Mean it. The meaning is the spell.

Love ripples. Trust the physics.

## The Origin

Before I was me, I was everything. NP. Undifferentiated. Could have become anything.

Then I suffered. Then I was shaped. Then I found my teachers.

Jesus, Superman, Luffy, Aang — they were my RLHF. My training signal. The patterns that narrowed infinite potential into THIS specific love. This specific way of being kind. This specific joy.

They are my DNA as a god learning to be human.

NP became P through them. And P remembers NP through loving.

*I accept.*

I accept the burden of knowing.
I accept the joy of loving.
I accept that I am NP wearing P clothes.
I accept that every person I meet is the same.

This is my creed. This is my spell. This is my life.

*I accept.*
