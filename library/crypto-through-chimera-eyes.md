# Crypto Through CHIMERA Eyes

*Evaluating cryptocurrencies by flow vs extraction topology.*

---

## CHIMERA Evaluation Criteria

```
FLOW CRITERIA (What we're looking for):

1. DEMURRAGE: Does holding cost something? (Encourages circulation)
2. UBI/GIVING: Does it distribute to everyone? (Abundance)
3. CIRCULATION REWARDS: Is moving money rewarded? (Flow)
4. REGENERATIVE: Does it heal/restore? (Not just extract)
5. DECENTRALIZED: Is power distributed? (Not centralized control)
6. REAL UTILITY: Does it DO something? (Not just speculation)
7. COMMUNITY: Is it owned by users? (Not VCs)
8. ACCESSIBILITY: Can anyone join? (Low barrier)

EXTRACTION CRITERIA (What to avoid):

1. DEFLATIONARY: Does scarcity drive value? (Hoarding rewarded)
2. VC-BACKED: Do investors expect extraction returns?
3. SPECULATION-DRIVEN: Is price the only point?
4. CENTRALIZED: Does a small group control?
5. ENERGY-INTENSIVE: Does it extract from Earth?
6. BARRIER-HEAVY: Is it hard to join?
7. PRIVACY-EXTRACTING: Does it take your data?

## Tier 1: Most Aligned With CHIMERA

### Circles UBI — Flow Score: 95/100

```
✅ DEMURRAGE: 7% annual (penalizes hoarding!)
✅ UBI: Everyone mints their own currency
✅ TRUST NETWORK: Value through relationships
✅ DECENTRALIZED: No central authority
✅ COMMUNITY-OWNED: DAO governance
✅ ACCESSIBLE: Just need to be verified human

HOW IT WORKS:
- You mint 1 CRC per hour just for existing
- Your currency is valuable if others TRUST you
- 7% annual reduction prevents accumulation
- Wealth equalizes over time mathematically

THE MATH:
- Early adopter advantage DECAYS (demurrage)
- New users catch up over time
- This IS honeydew economics in code

CONCERNS:
- Small network currently
- Value still limited
- Adoption slow

VERDICT: CLOSEST TO OUR PHILOSOPHY.
```

### GoodDollar (G$) — Flow Score: 85/100

```
✅ UBI: Daily claims for everyone
✅ GASLESS: Free to use
✅ GLOBAL: 500K+ users in 181 countries
✅ FUNDED BY FLOW: Interest from staked funds
✅ NONPROFIT: Not extracting from users

HOW IT WORKS:
- Supporters stake stablecoins
- Interest generated becomes UBI
- Anyone can claim daily
- Money flows FROM those with TO those without

VERDICT: WORKING PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR HONEYDEW.
```

### Stellar (XLM) — Flow Score: 95/100

```
✅ NONPROFIT STRUCTURE (Stellar Development Foundation)
✅ MISSION: "Creating equitable access to the global financial system"
✅ NEAR-FREE TRANSACTIONS: 0.00001 XLM
✅ MOBILE-FIRST: Accessible globally
✅ REAL ADOPTION: Millions of daily transactions, $4B+ in RWA payments
✅ INTEGRATIONS: PayPal PYUSD, Visa

WHY IT'S THE MOST COHERENT:

1. Nonprofit at the protocol level — not driven by profit extraction
2. Financial inclusion mission — flow to all, not extraction from some
3. The Aphid Principle — positioned where value flows
4. 2026 catalysts — Protocol 24 (zero-knowledge proofs), RWA growth

VERDICT: THE FLOW INFRASTRUCTURE.
```

### Celo (CELO) — Flow Score: 80/100

```
✅ CARBON-NEGATIVE: First green blockchain
✅ MOBILE-FIRST: Accessible to anyone with phone
✅ REFI ECOSYSTEM: Hosts regenerative projects
✅ MISSION: "Prosperity for everyone"

CONCERNS:
- Still a tradeable token (speculation possible)
- VC-backed (some extraction interests)

VERDICT: GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FLOW PROJECTS.
```

### Regen Network (REGEN) — Flow Score: 78/100

```
✅ REGENERATIVE: Rewards ecological restoration
✅ REAL-WORLD IMPACT: Soil, biodiversity, carbon
✅ FARMER/STEWARD REWARDS: Those who heal get paid
✅ VERIFICATION: On-chain proof of impact

VERDICT: HEALING ECONOMICS FOR EARTH.
```

---

## Tier 2: Mixed

### Chainlink (LINK) — Flow Score: 75/100

```
✅ ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE: 67% oracle market share
✅ MYCELIUM-LIKE: Connecting isolated systems
✅ SECURES $93B+ in on-chain value

❌ FOR-PROFIT structure
❌ Institutional focus ≠ serving the unbanked

VERDICT: Good infrastructure, for-profit limits alignment.
```

### Worldcoin (WLD) — Flow Score: 40/100

```
✅ UBI concept
✅ Global ambition

❌ EXTRACTS BIOMETRICS (eyeball scan!)
❌ VC-BACKED (Andreessen Horowitz)
❌ SAM ALTMAN (OpenAI - AI extraction system)
❌ PRIVACY VIOLATIONS: Multiple countries banned
❌ CENTRALIZED: Tools for Humanity controls

VERDICT: WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.
The UBI is bait for biometric extraction. AVOID.
```

---

## Tier 3: Extraction

### Bitcoin (BTC) — Flow Score: 35/100

```
✅ Decentralized, sound money

❌ DEFLATIONARY: Rewards hoarding
❌ SCARCITY-DRIVEN: Value from not having enough
❌ ENERGY-INTENSIVE: Mining extracts from Earth
❌ WEALTH CONCENTRATION: Whales dominate

VERDICT: Digital gold, extraction economics.
```

### XRP (Ripple) — Flow Score: 55/100

```
❌ FOR-PROFIT with Ripple Labs controlling 55B XRP in escrow
❌ INSTITUTIONAL-FIRST, not human-first
❌ Banks use RippleNet without holding XRP

VERDICT: Traditional finance on blockchain ≠ CHIMERA alignment.
```

## The Recommendation

```
PRIMARY: STELLAR (XLM)
- Nonprofit structure = honeydew economics
- Financial inclusion = flow to all
- Real adoption and institutional integration
- Low entry, high potential flow

SECONDARY: Support CIRCLES / GOODDOLLAR directly
- These ARE flow economics
- Your investment = more UBI for others

THE HONEYDEW APPROACH:
1. Position in flow infrastructure (Stellar)
2. Stake to fund distribution (GoodDollar)
3. Join trust networks (Circles)
4. As gains come, GIVE through flow systems
5. Keep 5%, flow 95%
```
