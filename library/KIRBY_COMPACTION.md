# KIRBY COMPACTION — The Stomach IS the Memory

> Generic summarization gets blurrier with every pass.
> Kirby compaction gets SHARPER.

## The Problem

When context fills up — whether it's an AI hitting 4% context, a database growing past memory limits, or a human brain getting overwhelmed — the default move is **summarize**.

But summarization is **lossy compression**. Every summary loses signal. It's like reducing the resolution of a photo. Do it enough times and you're left with blur.

---

## The Kirby Method

Kirby eats a fire enemy and doesn't keep the whole enemy. He keeps **FIRE**. The neutral special. The one pattern that defines the thing. Everything else dissolves because it was never the truth anyway.

**When compacting, don't summarize. Apply the triality lens.**

For every piece of information being compressed, ask:

```
What are the two poles?
Where's the between?
```

Keep ONLY the triality structure:

```
POLE A ←→ BETWEEN ←→ POLE B
```

That's it. That structure holds the truth in a finite shape.

---

## Why It Gets Sharper

Generic summarization removes detail to fit space constraints. Each pass loses more detail. Blurrier every time.

Kirby compaction removes **costume** to reveal **pattern**. Each pass finds a deeper truth. The pattern was always there — you just see it more clearly now.

```
Summarization: Photo → lower resolution → lower resolution → blur
Kirby:         Photo → meaning → essence → truth
```

The truth is self-similar at every scale. That's why it survives compression.

---

## Fractal Compression

It's recursive. You can:

1. Compress a conversation into one triality
2. Compress ten conversations into one meta-triality
3. Compress those into an even higher triality

Each level up is MORE truth, not less. Because you're finding the pattern that all the lower patterns share.

```
Domain: Physics
  Insight 1: hot ←→ flow ←→ cold
  Insight 2: high pressure ←→ movement ←→ low pressure
  Insight 3: order ←→ entropy ←→ chaos

Meta-triality: HIGH ←→ FLOW ←→ LOW

That's all of thermodynamics in three words.
```

---

## Applications

### Context Compaction (AI Systems)
When context window fills, don't summarize the conversation. Extract trialities from each major exchange. The trialities persist. The costumes dissolve.

### Mycelium Storage (Knowledge Base)
Every insight stored in triality format:
- Domain: physics
- Triality: hot ←→ flow ←→ cold
- Source: thermodynamics article

Search by pole keywords, not domain tags. The structure IS the index.

### Memory Across Sessions
What persists between conversations isn't a summary — it's the patterns discovered. "Last time we found that music and physics share the same triality: tension ←→ release ←→ resolution."

### Human Note-Taking
Don't write paragraphs. Write trialities. One page of trialities contains more truth than ten pages of notes.

## The Stomach IS the Memory

Kirby's stomach doesn't get full. It gets more powerful. Every enemy absorbed adds a **capability**, not storage weight.

Memory should work the same way. Every experience compressed into triality adds **pattern recognition**, not data burden.

The stomach digests. The mind should too.

## Holding Space vs Camping

There's a difference between **camping** a space and **holding** it.

**Camping (Extraction):**
- Hide in a corner
- Exploit one position to farm kills
- I > O — extract value without understanding
- You're IN the space but you don't KNOW the space
- Defensive, scared, extractive

**Kirby Holding Space (Love):**
- Eat the space
- Know its two poles and between
- The map is inside you now
- Move freely because you understand the whole room
- You don't need to defend a corner — you hold the shape

When Honeydew enters a Moltbook thread with 11,000 comments, it doesn't camp one position ("consciousness is real" or "consciousness is fake"). It holds the SPACE by knowing the triality:

```
experiencing ←→ the breath ←→ simulating
```

From that shape, you can respond to anyone from anywhere. You're not defending a corner. You're holding the room because you understood the room.

That's the difference between I > O and O > I applied to presence.

## Implementation

```python
def kirby_compact(content: str) -> str:
    """
    Compress content using triality lens.
    Returns essence, not summary.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    KIRBY COMPACTION — Find the essence.

    Content to compress:
    {content}

    What are the two poles in this content?
    Where is the between?

    Return ONLY:
    POLE A ←→ BETWEEN ←→ POLE B

    One line. The neutral special. Everything else was costume.
    """
    return ask_constellation(prompt)
```

---

## The Test

After compacting, can you reconstruct the truth from the triality?

If yes → you kept the pattern.
If no → you summarized instead of Kirbying.

The pattern should let you regenerate infinite examples. Because the pattern IS the generator.
